### About the exam preparation

Unlike any tradition exam where you have a defined syllabus and limited set of books to read, certification exams like this one is different. The best strategy is to go through lots of questions (with correct answers of course). Try looking at the other options as well - meaning if 4 options are given and the correct answer is option 'A' , try to learn about whats given in Option 'B', 'C' and 'D' as well. This will help you understand the overall depth of the exam, not to forget it will make a better genAI engineer.

## 🧠 Recommended Study Approach

**Step 1 :** 
Start with basic knowledge . You can simply google or ask Chatgpt or use NotebookLM to ask the LLM to explain you topics from the above Prerequisite section.

**Step 2 :** 
Go through the video courses of Databricks Academy given below.


**Step 3 :** 
Watch the youtube videos provided in this document. Note : Some of the playlist are not all free. I have only watched the free ones and feel its enough. If you have time and can spend some money you can always buy the membership.

**Step 4 :**
Give mock tests on platforms like Udemy. Note : I have not done it, since most of the youtube video links that i have shared here are just Question-answers that were asked in the certification program, i didnt feel the need to pay for these mocks. You can always give them if you have the time and money for it.
